        <h1 class="page__title">Accessibility audit of ASDA's grocery website</h1>

        <h2 class="section__heading">This involved finding barriers that prevent interaction or access to the website and suggesting improvements based on inclusive design principles.</h2><br>

        <h2 class="section__heading">Process</h2>
        <p class="main__text">To begin, a user journey was selected to limit the scope of the audit and to ensure that a key part of the site for the business was tested. A key task for customers is to book a delivery slot so users can receive their purchases. Therefore the following user journey was selected.</p><br>
        
        <p class="quote">“You are buying groceries for a dinner party you are organizing. Order the items to your home so that it arrives tomorrow at 3 pm.”</p><br>

        <p class="main__text">The audit was carried out with a combination of several techniques to ensure a thorough inspection of accessibility problems.</p><br>

        <h3 class="">(1)	Empathic modelling</h3><br>

        <p class="main__text">Empathy modelling is a technique that allows you to put yourself in the position of someone with an impairment, with the use of props. It’s great for raising awareness of difficulties that may exist. I did this by placing buttons on the joints of my hand and then sellotaping the buttons into place. The restrictors would cause pain as I moved my hands mimicking the experience of someone who had arthritis as they moved their joints. I also zoomed in to the website by 200% as I completed their user journey. </p><br>

        <p class="main__text">Both of these enactments would help us empathise with users who were from the elderly. When it comes to disability, I highlighted the elderly as an important sub-group, because the likelihood of gaining a disability increases with age. Also, people with physical impairments such as arthritis are more likely to require home deliveries as essential. </p><br>

        <h3>(2)	A manual audit carried out with the heuristics written by Deque and WCAG 2.1.</h3><br>

        <p class="main__text">The Deque heuristics list helped me find common accessibility problems, whilst WCAG 2.1 carried a longer more detailed list of guidelines. An example of some the steps carried out were checking the alternative text were provided in links, completing the user journey with voice-over on and the screen turned off, and using only the keyboard to access the site.  </p><br>


        <h3>(3)	Using the chrome DevTool called aXe</h3><br>

        <p class="main__text">This tool was created by Deque and it helped pick up the accessibility issues that were missed during the manual audit.<br> Using different methods to find accessibility issues, allowed a more stringent test of the website.</p><br>

        <ol>
            <h3>Severity of Accessibility Issues</h3><br>
            <li class="ordered__list">Very minor inconvenience: this issue is a minor irritant, minor inconvenience: doesn’t affect everyone but could impact the ability of some in using the page. </li>
            <li class="ordered__list">Average inconvenience: could impact some people’s ability to use the page. </li>
            <li class="ordered__list">Major inconvenience: Could prevent some people from accessing or using page content. </li>
            <li class="ordered__list">Extreme inconvenience: Will stop some users from using the website.</li>
          </ol><br>

          <h2 class="section__heading">Findings</h2>
          <p class="main__text">
            Here are the screenshots of where the problems were and recommendations based on inclusive design principles. 
            </p><br>

            <h3 class="subheading">Homepage</h3>

<img class="section__image" src="img/(1) Homepage-accessibility.jpg" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the accessibility problems are.">

<p class="main__text"><b>Where:</b> Sign-in button<br>
    <b>Violates:</b>WCAG: 1.4.3- Colour contrast and legibility<br>
    <b>Issue:</b> The sign-in button did not have a sufficient contrast ratio. <br>
    <b>Who it impacts: </b>This makes it difficult for users who are colour-blind to read the text. <br>
    <b>How was it found:</b> The chrome dev tool aXe.<br>
    <b>Severity: </b>extreme inconvenience. <br>
    <b>Recommendation: </b>To ensure compliance use at least 4.5:1 for small text or 3:1 for large text. The inclusive design principle that can be applied here is to provide a comparable experience by allowing users to apply colour filters to the website to suit their own needs. 
</p><br>

<p class="main__text"><b>Moving carousel:</b> Sign-in button<br>
    <b>Violates:</b> The Deque heuristic called control of movement and flashing.<br>
    <b>Issue:</b> The homepage does not allow users to pause the moving carousel.<br>
    <b>Who it impacts: </b> This is especially impactful for those who have Cognitive impairments such as ADHD and people who suffer from headaches and seizures<br>
    <b>How was it found:</b> During the manual audit.<br>
    <b>Severity: </b>extreme inconvenience. <br>
    <b>Recommendation: </b>The interaction design principle called Give control can be applied here. The user should be able to control the movement of the carousel, currently, you can only go and left and right but you cannot pause. 
</p><br>

<p class="main__text"><b>Where:</b> Check-out link <br>
    <b>Violates:</b> The Deque heuristic called account for multiple interaction methods.<br>
    <b>Issue:</b> The check-out button on the homepage is mouse-specific, so you cannot access it with a keyboard. <br>
    <b>Who it impacts: </b>This will impact users who are blind.<br>
    <b>How was it found:</b> During the manual audit.<br>
    <b>Severity: </b>extreme inconvenience. <br>
    <b>Recommendation: </b>Allow the checkout button on the homepage to be accessible via keyboard.
</p><br>

<img class="section__image" src="img/(2) Homepage 2.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the accessibility problems are."><br>
<p class="main__text"><b>Where:</b> Add and shop now button <br>
    <b>Violates:</b> The Predictability and Consistency Heuristic.<br>
    <b>Issue:</b> There was ambiguity regarding what the difference was between “add” and “shop now”.<br>
    <b>Who it impacts: </b>Screen reader users.<br>
    <b>How was it found:</b> During the manual audit.<br>
    <b>Severity: </b>Very minor inconvenience<br>
    <b>Recommendation: </b>This could be remedied by implementing the design Principe of ‘being consistent. All text which complete the same action should look the same and have the same label. 
</p><br>

<h3 class="subheading">Calendar</h3>
<img class="section__image" src="img/(3) Calendar.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the accessibility problems are."><br>
<p class="main__text">
    <b>Violates:</b> The Structure and Semantics of pages Heuristic.<br>
    <b>Issue:</b> When booking a date for the delivery, a calendar is provided which does not include a header or a description of what the page is about.<br>
    <b>Who it impacts: </b>Screen reader users.<br>
    <b>How was it found:</b> During the manual audit.<br>
    <b>Severity: </b>Average inconvenience.<br>
    <b>Recommendation: </b>A brief description of what the page is about should be included. The times and dates for the deliveries should also have a label so that users using screen readers can make sense of the structure of the content of the page.
</p><br>

<h3 class="subheading">Booking delivery form</h3>
<img class="section__image" src="img/(4) Excess whitespace.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the accessibility problems are."><br>
<p class="main__text">
    <b>Violates:</b> This violates the Navigation and wayfinding heuristic.<br>
    <b>Issue:</b> Excessive whitespace, we found that a lot of whitespace was used throughout the website which hurt the participant’s fingers when scrolling through the website.<br>
    <b>Who it impacts: </b>People with arthritis<br>
    <b>How was it found:</b> During the empathy modelling.<br>
    <b>Severity: </b>Extreme inconvenience<br>
    <b>Recommendation: </b>Avoid excessive whitespace that involves a lot of scrolling.
</p><br>

<img class="section__image" src="img/(5) booking form.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the accessibility problems are."><br>
<p class="main__text">
    <b>Violates:</b> The provide enough time and preserve information heuristic<br>
    <b>Issue:</b> The delivery booking form does not allow users to save and come back at a later point. Some people may get tired when filling out a form.<br>
    <b>Who it impacts: </b> Screen reader users.<br>
    <b>How was it found:</b> During the manual audit.<br>
    <b>Severity: </b>Empathy modelling<br>
    <b>Recommendation: </b>Users should be able to save the process and continue at a more convenient time. 
</p><br>

<h2 class="section__heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="main__text">The audit was successful in picking up a lot of issues users may face when using the website. The empathy modelling was good for raising awareness and building empathy, however, it does not replace the lived experience of having a disability and it is highly suggested that usability studies with disabled people are carried out on websites aimed at the general public.</p>

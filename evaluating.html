    <h1 class="page__title">Usability and User Experience Evaluation: World's Biggest Coffee Morning </h1>

    <h3>An evaluation which measured the usability and user experience (UX) of Cancer Macmillan's website the World's Biggest Coffee Morning. The website is used to encourage people to host a coffee morning. This involves getting the user to sign up so that they can receive a free fundraising pack and then use the website to donate the funds to Macmillan which is a cancer charity. </h3><br>

    <h2 class="section__heading">Process</h2><br>
<ol>
    <li class="ordered__list"><b>Pilot study- </b> to ensure there were no issues with the equipment or materials. </li>
    <li class="ordered__list"><b>Recruited participants-</b> overall, seven participants took part in the usability test. They were recruited because they knew of the charity and were interested in hosting an fundraiser.</li>
    <li class="ordered__list"><b>Homepage tour-</b> as the first goal of the study was to investigate what message the homepage was delivering to users and what users thought the purpose of the website was, the participants were asked: “If you want to take part in a coffee morning fundraiser, how would you go about doing so?” </li>
    <li class="ordered__list"><b>Usability testing-</b> I then provided the users with task scenarios which were supplemented with the concurrent think-aloud method. This meant that participants were given tasks to complete using the site whilst they spoke out loud what they were thinking. Also recorded, was whether the users successfully managed to complete the task and how difficult it was for them. </li>
    <!--<ul><p>The tasks users were instructed to complete were: </p>
        <li>Use the website to host a coffee morning </li>
        <li>Find a recipe for a vegan cake </li>
        <li>Find out how long it takes to bake a chosen recipe</li>
        <li>Find a recipe that doesn’t take long time to bake and doesn’t require many ingredients </li>
        <li>Donate the money you raised through the micro-site </li>
    </ul>
    -->
    <li class="ordered__list"><b>Questionnaire-</b> a modified User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS) questionnaire was administered, to gain a measure of how users experienced the website. The questionnaire focused on the user’s feelings, aesthetic preferences, and their reactions towards the website.</li>
  </ol><br>

  <h2 class="section__heading">Findings and Recommendations</h2>
  <img class="section__image" src="img/Macmillan-one.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the usability problems are."><br>

  <p>Finding 1: The homepage does not indicate clearly what the purpose of the website is.</p>

  <p class="main__text">Whilst all users understood the micro-site belonged to Macmillan there was confusion in the site's purpose, what a coffee morning was and what Macmillan was offering for those who wished to take part. <br><br><b>“More information about Macmillan should be on the home page rather than just the amount of money raised and a section to submit your donation.”</b>
  </p><br>

  <p>Recommendation 1: Add more content about Macmillan, where the money raised goes and the examples of previously held coffee mornings.</p>
  <p class="main__text">This would clarify for users, the purpose of the coffee morning and how they can get involved. 
  </p><br>

  <img class="section__image" src="img/macmillan-recipe.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the usability problems are."><br>

  <p>Finding 2: Users were not given enough tools to navigate the recipes section.</p>

  <p class="main__text">When navigating this section, users were not able to filter for special dietary requirements or time taken to make the ingredients. Tasks that involved finding a recipe on the Macmillan website were rated as the most difficult to complete by users. Users were also more likely to give up during these tasks. Not having the required filtering options was further made difficult by some ingredients not having preparation times available and users not understanding what some ingredients were.</b>
  </p><br>

  <p>Recommendation 2: To improve this section of the website, there should be an overhaul of the information architecture.</p>
  <p class="main__text">The navigation options should be organized according to the tasks users want to perform on that section. This can be done through interviews with users who would like to host their coffee morning, then creating a domain model to map all the key concepts, a card sort with real users to investigate how users would structure these recipes and then a tree-test to ensure that the website’s navigation works to help users achieve their goals. 
  </p><br>

  <img class="section__image" src="img/macmillan3.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage which highlights where the usability problems are."><br>

  <p>Finding 3: Throughout the website a light black font colour is used as texts over images. </p>

  <p class="main__text">A severe usability problem in Macmillan’s website is the use of a light black font over images. One user during the sign-up task stated the following as he was about to read the terms and conditions:<br> <b>“The page is quite cluttered, the background is loud and it takes my attention away from the text.” </b>
  </p><br>

  <p>Recommendation 3: Increase the contrast between the background and the text.</p>
  <p class="main__text">To improve the readability of the website and allow for a more user- friendly website, the text and the background should have higher contrast. The background should also use more white space to reduce clutter and create a clear background that minimizes distraction.

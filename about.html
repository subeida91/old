    <h1 class="page__title">About me</h1>
    <p class="main__text">
        In 2016 I graduated from City University, London with a Psychology degree. During my degree, I interned with the Psychology Department and ran a study which was funded by a bursary. I had won the bursary in an open competition run by the Educational Psychology Society (EPS). The bursary was intended for students who wanted to pursue a career in research.<br><br>

        After graduating, I worked for Start-up called Catapult. It was whilst working in a tech company that I became interested in the product side of the company.
        <br><br>

In  2019 I enrolled to study a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction and Design. Some of my modules included inclusive design, information architecture, website evaluations and interaction design. As part of my course, I learnt how to use Sketchapp to design systems, Azure to prototype and Maxqda to compile research.<br><br>

My Master's dissertation was based on work I completed with Microsoft Research, Cambridge as an intern. It was exciting working with their interdisciplinary team and being able to work with cutting edge technology that had not been released yet.  The project was focused on understanding how Blind users engage with a HoloLens headset that allows users to know who is around them. My dissertation was published with IUI and I was subsequently invited to present my findings at their conference in March 2020. <br><br>

After graduating, I worked with Fujitsu as a research associate, to design an AI system that leverages fairness when making loan decisions. I learnt a lot from this project and the study is now awaiting publication. My background has given me an understanding of how to research and design systems that enhance the experience of users.<br>
